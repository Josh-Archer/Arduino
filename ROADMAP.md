# ESP32 Smart Monitor Roadmap

## Core Reliability & Performance
- OTA Rollback Support: Allow firmware rollback if a new OTA update fails to boot or connect.
- Self-Healing WiFi: Automatic WiFi reconnection and fallback to secondary networks if the primary fails.
- Adaptive DNS Monitoring: Use AI/ML to detect patterns in DNS failures and proactively switch DNS or alert users before outages.

## Web & User Experience
- Real-Time Web Dashboard: Live graphs for signal, memory, DNS, and MQTT status with historical trends.
- Mobile-First PWA: Enhance the web UI for mobile, including push notifications and offline diagnostics.
- QR Code Device Setup: Generate a QR code for easy onboarding to WiFi/Home Assistant.

## Automation & Integrations
- Home Assistant Device Triggers: Expose device triggers for automations (e.g., “DNS down for 10 min”).
- IFTTT/Webhooks: Integrate with IFTTT or custom webhooks for broader automation.
- Auto-Discovery for Multiple Devices: Seamless management and monitoring of multiple ESP32 devices from a single dashboard.

## Security & Maintenance
- Encrypted OTA Updates: Add support for signed/encrypted firmware updates.
- Device Health Self-Test: Periodic self-diagnostics with reporting to Home Assistant.
- Remote Log Download: Download device logs from the web UI for troubleshooting.

## Advanced Monitoring
- Network Latency & Jitter Tracking: Monitor and report network quality, not just connectivity.
- Smart Power Management: Sleep/wake cycles based on network activity or Home Assistant commands.
- Sensor Expansion: Plug-and-play support for additional sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality).

## Developer & DevOps
- One-Click Local Dev Environment: Scripted setup for Windows/macOS/Linux, including all dependencies.
- GitHub Actions: Hardware-in-the-Loop CI: Automated tests on real hardware for every PR.
- Customizable Alert Templates: User-editable notification templates for Pushover, email, etc.

## Community & Documentation
- Interactive Setup Wizard: Step-by-step onboarding for new users in the web UI.
- In-UI Documentation: Contextual help and troubleshooting directly in the web interface.
- Community Plugin System: Allow users to contribute and load custom monitoring/automation plugins.
